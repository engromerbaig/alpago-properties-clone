## ⚠️ Known Limitations

This version was developed in **under 48 hours** and represents a basic functional MVP. Some known issues include:

- ⚠️ **Responsiveness**: Horizontal scroll section needs better handling on mobile/tablets
- ⚠️ **FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)**: Appears on load due to animation setup
- ⚠️ **Basic Loader**: Implemented, but lacks branding polish
- ⚠️ **SEO**: Only root-level `metadata` provided via `app/layout.js`; no OG tags, structured data, or dynamic metadata
- ⚠️ **Accessibility**: Semantic structure and ARIA roles yet to be optimized
