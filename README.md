> 🧠 **Note**: Data is currently handled via local JS/TS files under `constants/`. This is a placeholder and follows the **"File-Based Mocking"** pattern for rapid prototyping. In a production version, this will be replaced by **serverless functions or CMS-powered API routes** (e.g., `/api/projects`).

## ✅ Features Implemented

- ✅ Responsive layout for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile
- ✅ GSAP-powered scroll and entry animations
- ✅ Component-based architecture for scalability
- ✅ Loader (basic)
- ✅ Deployed and publicly accessible version

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (MVP Status)

This version is a **minimal working clone** built under a strict 48-hour deadline. Some known issues and improvement areas include:

- ❌ **Responsiveness Issues**: The horizontal scroll section requires refinement for smaller viewports.
- ❌ **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)**: Present due to current animation setup and CSS loading strategy.
- ❌ **Loader**: Only a basic loader is implemented; could be improved with branding or skeleton loaders.
- ❌ **SEO**: Not optimized – no meta tags, OG tags, or structured data added yet.
- ❌ **Accessibility**: ARIA roles and focus management not yet implemented.

---

## 📤 Deliverables

- ✅ **Live Deployment**: [https://alpago-properties-clone.netlify.app/](https://alpago-properties-clone.netlify.app/)
- ✅ **Codebase**: Available on GitHub (private or shared upon request)

---

## 📆 Timeline

This version was completed within the assigned **48-hour window**, prioritizing core layout, component structure, and animation fidelity over polish or optimization.

---

## 📈 Next Steps (If Continued)

- 🔄 Refactor dummy data to use **Next.js API Routes** or integrate with a **headless CMS** (e.g., Sanity, Strapi)
- ⚙️ Improve animation sequencing and performance
- 🪄 Implement SSR/SEO best practices
- 🧪 Add testing with Jest + React Testing Library
- 🌐 Improve accessibility and Lighthouse scores
